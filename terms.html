            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of mobile applications and services ("Apps") provided by Lost Pines Creative LLC ("we," "us," or "our"), a Texas limited liability company based in Bastrop, Texas.</p>
            <p>By downloading, installing, or using any of our Apps — including NomadCore, Remember Who, Evident House, and Sovereign School — you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use our Apps.</p>

            <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
            <p>You must be at least 13 years of age to use our Apps. If you are under 18, you may only use our Apps with the involvement and consent of a parent or legal guardian.</p>

            <h2>3. License</h2>
            <p>We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use our Apps for personal, non-commercial purposes, subject to these Terms.</p>
            <p>You may not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Apps</li>
                <li>Redistribute, sublicense, or resell the Apps</li>
                <li>Use the Apps for any unlawful purpose</li>
                <li>Attempt to circumvent any security or access controls</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Your Data & Privacy</h2>
            <p>Privacy is core to everything we build. Here is how we handle your data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>On-device by default.</strong> Your data is stored locally on your device. We do not upload, collect, or have access to your personal data unless you explicitly choose to use an optional cloud feature.</li>
                <li><strong>You own your data.</strong> Content you create — contacts, notes, plans, documents — belongs to you. You may export it at any time.</li>
                <li><strong>No tracking, no ads, no data sales.</strong> We do not use analytics trackers, serve advertisements, or sell your information to third parties.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If any App offers optional cloud-based features (such as cloud transcription), we will clearly disclose what data is transmitted and to whom before you enable those features. For full details, see our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

            <h2>5. AI Features</h2>
            <p>Some of our Apps include artificial intelligence features, such as on-device voice transcription or AI-assisted recommendations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>On-device processing.</strong> Where possible, AI processing runs entirely on your device and no data leaves your phone.</li>
                <li><strong>Optional cloud processing.</strong> If an App offers cloud-based AI (e.g., cloud transcription), it will be clearly labeled as optional and require your explicit consent before any data is sent externally.</li>
                <li><strong>Accuracy.</strong> AI-generated content may contain errors. You are responsible for reviewing and verifying any AI output before relying on it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. App-Specific Disclaimers</h2>

            <h3>NomadCore — Emergency Preparedness</h3>
            <p>NomadCore provides emergency preparedness information and tools for educational and planning purposes. <strong>It is not a substitute for professional emergency services, medical advice, or official government guidance.</strong> Always call 911 or your local emergency number in an emergency. We make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of procedural content but cannot guarantee it is current, complete, or applicable to your specific situation. You assume all risk when acting on information provided by the App.</p>

            <h3>Evident House — Insurance Documentation</h3>
            <p>Evident House provides tools for documenting personal property. <strong>We do not guarantee that any insurer, adjuster, or court will accept documentation generated by the App.</strong> The App is not a substitute for professional insurance advice. Cryptographic timestamps provide evidence of when documentation was created but do not constitute a legal guarantee of any kind.</p>

            <h3>Sovereign School — Education</h3>
            <p>Sovereign School is an educational tool designed to assist parents. <strong>It is not a replacement for parental judgment or oversight.</strong> The parent retains ultimate authority and responsibility for their child's education. We do not guarantee compliance with your state's homeschool laws or any particular educational outcome.</p>

            <h2>7. Payments & Subscriptions</h2>
            <p>Our Apps are distributed through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. All purchases and payments are processed by those platforms and subject to their terms and refund policies.</p>
            <p>If an App offers a subscription, you may cancel at any time through your device's app store settings. We do not impose cancellation penalties or hidden fees.</p>

            <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>All App code, design, trademarks, and branding are the property of Lost Pines Creative LLC. You retain full ownership of any content you create within our Apps.</p>

            <h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
            <p>Our Apps are provided <strong>"as is" and "as available"</strong> without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.</p>
            <p>We do not warrant that the Apps will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components, or that any data stored on your device will be preserved in all circumstances. We encourage regular backups.</p>

            <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Lost Pines Creative LLC shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Apps, including but not limited to loss of data, loss of profits, or personal injury.</p>
            <p>Our total liability for any claim arising under these Terms shall not exceed the amount you paid for the App in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.</p>

            <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
            <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Lost Pines Creative LLC from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from your misuse of the Apps or violation of these Terms.</p>

            <h2>12. Governing Law & Disputes</h2>
            <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising under these Terms shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Bastrop County, Texas.</p>

            <h2>13. Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you through an in-app notification or by updating the effective date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Apps after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

            <h2>14. Termination</h2>
            <p>You may stop using our Apps and delete them at any time. Your locally stored data remains on your device and under your control even after uninstalling.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to cloud-based features with reasonable notice if you violate these Terms.</p>

            <h2>15. Severability</h2>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
